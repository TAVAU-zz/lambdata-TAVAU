Hi Yuhan,

Very nice code. It's clean and clear. That was a good idea to import train_test_split with a new name.
I also like that you explain 'frac' clearly as a percentage input. And it's a nice list you made for 
future functions with a temporary 'pass' on them. Well done.

The only thing I could think to add on is a docstring at the beginning, explaining what the group of
functions are for.
